Steganography – Secure Data Hiding Application

A steganography-based application that hides secret information inside digital media (such as images) to ensure secure and discreet data communication.
The project focuses on data security, confidentiality, and practical implementation of information hiding techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another non-secret file so that the existence of the hidden data is not easily detectable.
This project allows users to embed secret messages into images and later extract them securely, making it useful for privacy-focused communication.

The project demonstrates my understanding of information security fundamentals and secure data handling.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Pillow (PIL)

Tkinter / CLI (based on implementation)

✨ Key Features

🔐 Hide secret text inside image files

📤 Extract hidden messages securely

🖼️ Image-based steganography using LSB technique

⚡ Lightweight and easy-to-use interface

🛡️ Preserves image quality after encoding

🧠 Core Technique Used
Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography

Modifies the least significant bits of image pixels

Ensures minimal visual difference between original and encoded images

Maintains high imperceptibility and data integrity

🔐 Security & Data Handling

Hidden data is not visible to the human eye

Optional password-based protection (if implemented)

Controlled extraction of embedded messages

No alteration of original image structure
